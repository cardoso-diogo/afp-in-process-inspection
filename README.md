## 🎯 Project Goal

This project provides a complete, modular pipeline for the in-process acquisition, processing and analysis of manufacturing data from an Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) system. The framework uses a laser line scanner and real-time robot pose data to generate a metrologically accurate "as-built" geometric digital twin of the composite layup, enabling a shift from post-process inspection to in-process verification.

## 🧱 System Architecture

The framework is built on a model-driven architecture that decouples the high-level manufacturing plan from the low-level data acquisition and processing logic. A central, multi-threaded Python application orchestrates data collection from the KUKA robot controller and the Micro-Epsilon laser scanner.

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow & Usage

The analysis is performed by executing the Python scripts sequentially. The workflow is divided into two main stages: the **Core Analysis Pipeline**, which generates the primary 2D reconstruction and QC report, and the **Advanced Analysis & Visualization** steps for deeper diagnostic insights.

### Core Analysis Pipeline

This is the main workflow for processing the raw data into a final quantitative summary.

| Step | Script | Description |
|:---:|---|---|
| 0️⃣ | `main.py` | **Live Acquisition:** Connects to hardware and records raw sensor and robot data based on the `layup_plan.json`. |
| 1️⃣ | `create_sync_data.py` | **Synchronization:** Merges raw robot poses and laser profiles using timestamps. |
| 2️⃣ | `extract_features.py` | **Feature Extraction:** Detects tow and gap edges from each laser profile using a state-aware heuristic. |
| 3️⃣ | `transform_features.py` | **3D Transformation:** Converts 2D sensor features into 3D world coordinates using the hand-eye calibration. |
| 4️⃣ | `analyze_layup.py` | **Analysis & Reporting:** Computes inter-tow QC metrics (gap, step, etc.) and generates the final 2D reconstruction plot and QC report. |

**To run the full core post-processing pipeline:**
```bash
# Processes raw data from a completed acquisition (Step 0)
python create_sync_data.py
python extract_features.py
python transform_features.py
python analyze_layup.py
```

---

### Advanced Analysis & Visualization

These scripts provide insights into path fidelity and allow for interactive 3D inspection. They should be run after the core pipeline is complete.

| Step | Script | Description |
|:---:|---|---|
| 5️⃣ | `compute_fidelity_metrics.py` | **Path Fidelity Analysis:** Calculates metrics like Lateral Path Deviation (LPD) to assess the robot's dynamic placement accuracy. |
| 6️⃣ | `create_structured_surface.py` | **Surface Generation:** Processes the synchronized scan data into a structured point cloud (`.ply` file) suitable for 3D viewing. |
| 7️⃣ | `inspect_structured_surface.py` | **Interactive Visualization:** Launches an advanced GUI tool for detailed 3D inspection of the generated surface, including virtual slicing. |

**To run the advanced analysis steps:**
```bash
# (Run this after the core pipeline is complete)
# To calculate path fidelity metrics:
python compute_fidelity_metrics.py

# To generate and then inspect the 3D surface:
python create_structured_surface.py
python inspect_structured_surface.py
```

## 📂 Data & Folder Structure

The project expects a specific hierarchical folder structure for data management. All raw and processed data for a given manufacturing session is stored in a timestamped directory.
